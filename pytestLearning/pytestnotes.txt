"Pytest is a testing engine on which we write Playwright test cases"
""Pytest is a testing framework in which we write test code, and Playwright is a browser automation library that can be used within pytest to perform end-to-end tests.""

To break it down:
Pytest → A test runner and framework that helps organize, run, and report on test cases.

Playwright → A browser automation tool used for UI testing.

Together: You write your test scripts using Playwright APIs inside Python functions, and use pytest to execute and manage those tests.

if you want to see the output or print statement
you have to use command = "pytest -s"

What is setup and teardown setup in pytest using python fixtures with yield keyword?



@pytest.fixture(scope="function") # runs each time when it called in test each test file
def beforeEveryFunction():
    print("This is a setup that runs before every function")
    # Code before yield will run before the test function and kown as setup
    yield # This yield statement allows you to run some code before and after the test function
    # Code after yield will run after the test function completes and known as teardown
    print("This is a teardown that runs after every function")
    return "passed"  # This return value can be used in the test function that uses this fixture


how to skip any test?
we have @pytest.mark.skip
@pytest.mark.skipif

command to run a marked test fucntion?
pytest -m markname like skip
pytest -m skip
